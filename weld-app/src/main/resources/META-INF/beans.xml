<!--
    This file is needed IF you choose to boot your application via StartMain.main() method from Weld SE.
    This is because Weld does not support implicit bean archives in Java SE, for some reason.
    So you need to explicitly mark this JAR as a bean archive with this (effectively) empty beans.xml.
