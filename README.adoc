# Example Java SE + CDI 1.2 applications

This repository contains one application based on *OpenWebBeans*, and another based on *Weld SE*.

This is using *gradle* build system, but you do not need to install that in order to build this.
All you need is *Java SE JDK*, version 7 or newer.
Both Oracle and OpenJDK should work.

Clone this repository:

  git clone https://github.com/vmj/cdi-se-example.git
  cd cdi-se-example

After cloning this repository, build the apps as follows:

  ./gradlew installDist # or, if on Windows, use the gradlew.bat batch file instead

Don't worry, that will not install anything outside the source directory.
The apps are installed into `{owb,weld}-app/build/install/{owb,weld}-app` directory.

Now you can run the apps like this:

  owb-app/build/install/owb-app/bin/owb-app
  weld-app/build/install/weld-app/bin/weld-app

You can clean up, too

  ./gradlew clean
