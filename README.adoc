# Example Java SE + CDI 1.2 applications

This repository contains one application based on *OpenWebBeans*, and another based on *Weld SE*.
Those are CDI (think dependency injection) containers readily usable in a Java SE environment.
For example, small apps or 12 factor apps.

## Why and What?

Think what you will about the enterprise Java as a whole, some of their technologies are really neat.
Also, since they are more and more usable without any heavy frameworks or boilerplate or configuration,
they are a real contender in Java SE space.

Dependency injection allows you to decouple the components of your app,
so you don't need to spend any time thinking about constructing and wiring up your beans.
CDI also takes care of lifecycle management of those components,
so you get safe singletons without even thinking about multi-threading issues.
CDI even has a neat event system.
All this with next to no annotations or configuration.

## How it works

This project contains a `bean-archive`, which is just a JAR really,
that contains CDI compatible beans, which are just POJOs really.
This JAR forms the actual application.
There's an `App` class that listens to a CDI event to start whatever the app does.

Then there are two Java applications: `owb-app` and `weld-app`.
Both are really small.
All they do is, they use container specific way of constructing the CDI container and then fire the
CDI event expected by the app in the `bean-archive`.

That's it.  (See the source code for more comments.)

## How to try it out

I'm is using *gradle* build system, but you do not need to install that in order to build this.
All you need is *Java SE JDK*, version 7 or newer.
Both Oracle and OpenJDK should work.

Clone this repository:

  git clone https://github.com/vmj/cdi-se-example.git
  cd cdi-se-example

Then build the apps by invoking the provided build script.

E.g. if you're on Linux or Unix or OSX, use:

  ./gradlew installDist

Or, if you're on Windows, use:

  gradlew.bat installDist

Don't worry, those will not install anything outside the source directory.
The apps are installed into `build/install` directories relative to the app source code.

Hence, you can run the apps like this:

  owb-app/build/install/owb-app/bin/owb-app
  weld-app/build/install/weld-app/bin/weld-app

You can clean up, too

  ./gradlew clean
